# CSC1003 AE21 Naive Bayes Project

## Project Brief

Write a program to eventually arrive immediately at the doctor’s patient fertility diagnostic 
conclusion whenever she keys in on the spot the answer for the 9 attributes with the patient and 
predict the patient’s semen analysis outcome using Naive Bayes (NB) classifier. Calculate both 
training and test accuracy for the NB classifier with data radio 80 (training) : 20 (testing). Determine 
and plot the confusion matrix and calculate the time required for the whole program from 
extracting the given dataset. 

## How to run
- Ensure GCC compiler is present in system
- Ensure GNUPLOT is installed, and PATH variables are set
- In the same directory as ```project.c, project.h unit_test.c, gnuscript.txt```,
compile the binary by entering in command prompt ```gcc -o project project.c unit_test.c```
- Run the unit tests by entering in command prompt ```.\project t```
- Run the main program by entering in command prompt ```.\project```
